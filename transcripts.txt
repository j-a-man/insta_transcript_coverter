"I always come second." I don't think I noticed it at first, but it just kept happening. Finalist, runner-up, almost. And for a while, I thought it was kind of funny. Like, at some point, you just assume your turn is coming, right? It didn't. And you know the worst part? Second, in the grand scheme of things, is a great result. It's better than third, certainly better than fourth, and always better than someone who didn't even try. But that bitter feeling of what if is what always gets me. When you come first, people know what to say to you. I knew you'd win, congratulations. But when you come second? In my life, I mostly heard, you were so close, you'll get in next time. And then the conversation ends. You take the medal home, and you stay with it longer than you expected to. But you know the beauty of it? Second place never gave me answers. It gave me time. Time to stay with myself and ask if I still wanted it without the applause. And maybe that's the strange beauty of coming second. I didn't get carried forward, but I chose to keep going. And eventually, after all the disappointment, the what-ifs, and the overthinking, I took it all.

"2026 is the new 2016." Why? What about 2016 was so special? The fact that you could dab without thinking it's cringe? When we could dance and post without second guessing ourselves? The truth is, it's when we truly didn't care about what others thought of us. We missed the carefree energy, content that isn't hyper-designed for the algorithm, and genuine community in a world full of AI bots. That 10-year-old version of you back then, you were happy. Happy because you were unapologetically you, not because you needed to fit a trope to be normal. So if we really want to make 2026 feel like 2016, stop caring. Nobody cares anymore. Whether it's Rio de Janeiro or Midnight, skinny or baggy jeans, brain rot or vine, be yourself. Everybody else is already taken.

"I'm 19 years old and I'm running out of time." Because if I die at 100, I've got about 29,000 days left. And I've only lived 7,150 days so far, most of which by the way were spent learning how to walk, asking for permission to use the bathroom, and thinking Fortnite YouTuber was a viable career. But sure, now's the moment I should have it all figured out. House, dream car, life purpose, Because they're 16 year old millionaires, right? So if I don't make it by 20, that's it, right? And oh yeah, don't forget, this panic came from a rectangle in my pocket showing me highlight reels from people who are also pretending they know what they're doing. See how stupid all this sounds? Trust me, you're not running out of time. You actually have too much time. So instead of worrying about what others are doing online, why don't you figure out how you're going to use the 29,000 chances you'll have?

When's the first time you fell in love? Yeah, that person. When you were young, dumb, and probably not ready. Now, let me ask you something. Did you ever say, I love you to them? Well, probably not as early as I did. I said it after two weeks. Yeah, it was stupid. And honestly, I get it. You know, it's moving way too fast, right? But in that moment, it felt right. And that got me thinking, why does saying I love you hold so much weight? When we're kids, we say it freely, right? Like to friends, to family, but somewhere along the way, it turns into this big, scary thing. Like saying it means commitment, or that you're not allowed to take it back. But maybe it's not that deep. Maybe it's just three words that mean I care about you right now. So maybe saying it early wasn't me being stupid. Maybe it was just me being honest.

I have a really common name, Daniel Park. You know, I didn't really think about it growing up, but I didn't realize how common my name was until the internet told me. Taken, not available, and it's not just usernames. When someone asks for my social media, I already know what's about to happen. They search it, they scroll, and then they ask, wait, which one are you? I never chose my name thinking it would make me invisible. When my family moved to Canada, I just picked something simple, something people could say. I didn't know I was picking a name that belonged to everyone else. But having a name like that does something to you. You realize you can't rely on search results or usernames to explain who you are. So you start leaving proof instead. You make things. You show up. You do stuff people can't ignore. And maybe that's the trade-off. If your name blends in, the way you live can't.
